## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view potential pets that are up for adoption that fit my needs OR list an animal to find new owners.

## Description
'Perfect Pet' greets the user with a warm welcoming page displaying our mission and options for quickly finding a pet. There will be filters available to find a specific pet based on the user's preferences. Each pet will have an image, name, age, gender. On the other side, those who want to put a pet up for adoption can add their pet with all the necessary information to find potential adopters.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view potential pets that are up for adoption that fit my needs OR list an animal to find new owners.

## Description

'Perfect Pet' greets the user with a warm welcoming page displaying our mission and options for quickly finding a pet. There will be filters available to find a specific pet based on the user's preferences. Each pet will have an image, name, age, gender. On the other side, those who want to put a pet up for adoption can add their pet with all the necessary information to find potential adopters.

## How to Use

The login/signup button in the top-right corner prompts the user to make an account with a password that is saved via cookies to prevent constant logout. Under the "New Pet" tab, the user (whilst in their account) can upload a pet with their cooresponding name, age, gender, and an image to post onto the public gallery. Users can also interact with posts from others with comments and likes.
